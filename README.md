# QAI Nexus Control

QAI Nexus Control is a web application that simulates the Nexus Project, a sophisticated, quantum-inspired multi-agent AI system. Users can input a high-level mission, and the AI Orchestrator will generate a strategic plan, decomposing the mission into tasks and assigning them to specialized agents. The interface provides a comprehensive suite of tools for monitoring, interacting with, and upgrading the QAI system.

## Core Features

- **Mission Planning & Execution:** Define a high-level mission objective, and watch as the Orchestrator generates a multi-phase tactical plan and executes it step-by-step.
- **Agent Interaction:** Engage directly with specialized AI agents through a stateful chat interface or probe their core cognitive functions (Induction, Reasoning, Recursion).
- **System Integrity Monitoring:** A holistic view of the QAI's operational status, including real-time quantum and classical compute resource usage, ethical alignment monitoring, and predictive self-healing capabilities.
- **Strategic Evolution:** Follow and participate in a multi-phase strategic roadmap to upgrade the system's core capabilities, from enhancing the quantum core to implementing self-evolving algorithms.
- **Generative Simulation:** Use a multi-modal generative engine to create and analyze complex "what-if" scenarios for agents.
- **Orchestrator Dialogue:** Converse with the master Orchestrator AI to gain insights into the system's architecture, mission status, and strategic decisions.
- **Knowledge Core:** Review the foundational principles of the QAI system and query the knowledge base directly.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **AI Backend:** Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash`)

## System Architecture

The QAI Nexus system is composed of several key components:

- **Orchestrator AI:** The central AI responsible for planning, tasking, and resource management.
- **Specialized Agents:**
  - **Scientific Discovery:** For data analysis, research, and hypothesis testing.
  - **Societal Modeling:** For ethical analysis, social impact modeling, and human behavior simulation.
  - **Planetary Exploration:** For logistics, navigation, and environmental analysis.
- **Advanced Modules:** As the system evolves, new modules are integrated, including:
  - **CEREA (Contextual Ethical Reasoning & Alignment Engine):** Ensures ethical decision-making.
  - **PSHARM (Predictive Self-Healing & Adaptive Resilience Module):** Proactively prevents system failures.
  - **SKF (Semantic Knowledge Fabric):** A dynamic, self-organizing knowledge base.
  - **Self-Evolving Algorithm Framework:** Allows the system to autonomously improve its own logic.

This application is designed to run in a modern web environment with access to the Google Gemini API.
